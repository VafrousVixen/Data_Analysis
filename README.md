# Data Analysis Results

**Question 1**: What state had the most fatal accidents involving non-motorists in 2016?

> California

**Question 2**: What circumstances most commonly involved non-motorists in a fatal accident in 2016?

> Crossing Roadway

# Development Environment

### *General*

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.8.5 32-bit
* Git / GitHub

### *Modules*

* Pandas - data structure and analysis tool
* Matplotlib - data visualization tool

# Useful Websites

* [Pandas Reference Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html)
* [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)

# Future Work

* Make the graphs more visually appealing and informative.
* Obtain number of accidents by pairing more than one column together when counting so that the number will be more accurate.
* Create comparison between number of people involved in the accident and the circumstances surrounding the fatality.
